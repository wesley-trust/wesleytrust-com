Thanks for stopping by. This is my new blog, where I hope to share the tech I'm passionate about, the personal projects I'm working on, as well as hints and tips from my experience.

## Key things I'm passionate about:
### Microsoft Cloud
I've been working with Microsoft Azure now since 2014, and Microsoft 365 since 2016, after a career working with Windows Server, Exchange Server and System Center.
### Infrastructure as Code
I'm fully onboard with the DevOps culture and mindset, and the only way to be efficient is to automate and not waste time clicking through a GUI.
### Scripting
Specifically with PowerShell, it's hugely versatile, and makes automating tasks, from simple commands, to complex functions easy.
### CD/CD Pipeline
Automating deployments and releases using Azure Pipelines, so you can rollout changes to multiple environments after a repo commit quickly. Amazing.

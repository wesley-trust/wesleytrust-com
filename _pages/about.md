I am inquisitive, creative, love problem solving and have a passion for technology, as well as interests in badminton, film and music. I am social, enjoy tech meet ups, tech conferences and drinks with friends.

I enjoy working on personal projects, with personal Azure and Microsoft 365 environments, a toolbox of scripts in GitHub, with my career goals focused on Cloud Architecture, Infrastructure as Code, Automation and DevOps.

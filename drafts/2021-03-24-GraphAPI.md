## What is the Microsoft Graph API
Well, this is Microsoft's "API to rule them all", though, it's mostly used for integrating with Microsoft's SaaS services, such as Microsoft 365 as well as Azure AD. A large amount of Microsoft 365 services now use this API to exchange data, especially Microsoft Teams.

The great thing, is that this API allows for you to treat many of Microsoft's services as Infrastructure as Code, in a more declarative fashion, like Terraform or with ARM templates that people are used to when deploying Azure resources.

Services such as Conditional Access policies can be defined in JSON definitions, and then using the correct API method, it can Create, modify, or remove the policies.

This is a big advantage over say, using the Graph API in a more imperative way such as in traditional PowerShell modules, as rather than having to call a lot of functions to create each step, you can provide an object definition, and the API will do a lot of the heavy lifting.
